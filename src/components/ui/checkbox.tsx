// This file is for the ShadCN Checkbox component.
// Since ShadCN is being removed, this file's content is no longer necessary
// if all uses of <Checkbox> are replaced with <input type="checkbox">.
// If this file is imported directly anywhere, those imports need to be updated.
// For now, leaving it empty to signify it's part of the removed library.
// Ideally, this file would be deleted.
